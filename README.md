Naive Bayes Classification to classify movie reviews as positive or negative

Here we perform sentiment analysis of movie reviews using Naive Bayes.

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods. In spite of their apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously document classification and spam filtering.
Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.

Accuracy, Precision and F-Score are also been measured and the entire process is documented in the PDF(which also contains some theory which was used as a reference to complete the project).
